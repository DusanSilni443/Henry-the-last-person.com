It began with whispers, rumors of a strange illness that spread rapidly, defying all known boundaries. As days turned into weeks, and weeks into months, the virus became an unstoppable force, leaving devastation in its wake. Henry, a humble farmer, was unaware of the impending chaos as he tended to his beautiful farm nestled in the heart of the countryside.
